# Programmer Keyboard iOS App

A custom iOS keyboard extension designed specifically for programmers, featuring easy access to programming symbols and code snippets.

## Current State

This project is currently in **restoration phase** after being restructured. The current codebase contains:

- ‚úÖ **Main App**: SwiftUI-based iOS app with Core Data integration
- ‚úÖ **Project Structure**: Clean Xcode project with proper organization  
- ‚úÖ **Build System**: Functional build configuration
- ‚ùå **Keyboard Extension**: Currently missing - needs to be restored
